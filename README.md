# QGen

QGen is a series of dice tables that can be used to randomly generate a
queer NPC for any tabletop roleplaying game.

**Important Note:** These tables are designed for creating interesting
NPCs, and do not reflect actual demographics of queer people in any way!

## Current Status

As I am no longer actively developing this project, I have set this repository to
"public archive".
