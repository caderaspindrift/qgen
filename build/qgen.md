# QGen

QGen is a series of dice tables that can be used to randomly generate a
queer NPC for any tabletop roleplaying game.

**Important Note:** These tables are designed for creating interesting
NPCs, and do not reflect actual demographics of queer people in any way!

[No Fascists]{.sidehead}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 
If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 
Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. Watch some Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or 
something.

## Safety Tools {#safety}

Playing the *Virago* RPG should be enjoyable for everyone, but it's a game with a dark
tone to it. Issues of rejection, loss, and emotional pain are at the core of *Virago*.

To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend the *TTRPG Safety Toolkit*,
which we've included below. You should not play *Virago* without using at least
one such tool in your game.

In addition, we specifically call out certain points in the rules that need special attention
from Game Guides and players. These are marked with an [alert symbol]{.cw}.

### Safety Tools

#### What are safety tools?

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or GM may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and GMs to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As a GM, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

#### The toolkit

Different safety tools work better for different
people and games. Finding the ones that best suit
the needs of everyone at the table is important, and
should be facilitated through discussion at the start
of every new game or new group.

This guide provides summaries of some safety
tools and techniques (with the original designers’
permission) to add to your own toolkit. This
includes the X-card system, the Script Change
RPG Toolbox, the Luxton Technique, and more.
Sources and links are provided at the end of this
guide for the full original materials, and the toolkit is
regularly updated with new tools.

### Before the Game Begins

#### Session 0

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

#### Lines and Veils

Lines and veils are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. Lines are hard limits on
content, things that the GM or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. Veils are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. Lines and
veils can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

#### Script Change Rating

Script Change ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). The rating also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. Ratings and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### Luxton Technique Discussion

In the Luxton Technique, have an open
discussion between everyone at the table
about potential trauma triggers. This is with the
understanding that it’s not possible to identify every
single possible trigger or trauma, and that there is
no social pressure to go into details or individual
justifications for a trigger.

### During the Game

#### X, N, and O Cards

X, N, and O cards are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The X card can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the X card is used by
tapping the card or typing an “X” in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The N card can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
N card is used by tapping the card or typing an
“N” in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The O card can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the O card is used by tapping the card
or typing an “O” in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a “O?” asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

### Script Change

The Script Change RPG Toolbox is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

Rewind (<<) can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When Rewind (<<) is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

Fast Forward (>>) can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When Fast Forward (>>) is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

Pause (II) can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When Pause (II) is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
Pause (II), you can Resume (>), Rewind (<<),
or Fast Forward (>>).

Resume (>) can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When Resume (>) is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

#### Luxton Technique

With the Luxton Technique, when a participant
comes across triggering content in play, they can
choose to discuss it with the other people at the
table. The participant is given complete control
over that content, expressed as a need or want for
how play will continue. This can include in-game
directions for plot and characters, as well as out
of game needs such as breaks. After the need and
wants are expressed, everyone continues play to
accomodate the requests.

#### Open Door

The Open Door is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

#### Breaks

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

### After the Game

#### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and GM if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

#### Aftercare

Together as a group after the game, check-in with
everyone to see how they are feeling. This is an
open way for everyone to emotionally decompress,
talk through, and process the events of the session
in a safe environment.

Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of
self-care and remind them that their mental health
comes first.

#### Debriefing

Debriefing as a group is a great way to reflect on
the game, identify possible issues, highlight the
fun things to continue, and work through potential
bleed. Debriefing can happen right after the game
or in the days following the stream.

#### Stars and Wishes

Stars and wishes are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

Stars are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, an encounter created
by the GM, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

Wishes are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between characters, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

#### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session

Similar to stars and wishes, Script Change
has Highlight Reel and Wrap Session. The
Highlight Reel is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay, an
encounter created by the GM, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The Wrap Session is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.

          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).
       
A.  Other rights.

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a 
       collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
       licensing scheme.

    1. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(A)(1) in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed 
       Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by 
       providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
       information.

    1. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information 
       required by Section 3(A)(1)(a) to the extent reasonably practicable.

       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to 
Your use of the Licensed Material:

A.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(A)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
