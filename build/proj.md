# QGen:
## Random Queer Character Generator

QGen is a series of dice tables that can be used to randomly generate a
queer NPC for any tabletop roleplaying game.

**Important Note:** These tables are designed for creating interesting
NPCs, and do not reflect actual demographics of queer people in any way!

## Qex

The example character we'll be referring to throughout this document is
named **Qex** -- standing for "queer example". You would, of course, use
a name of your own choosing if you use this to create an NPC.

[No Fascists]{.sidehead .inclu}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

## Gender

The first thing we're going to determine about Qex is their gender. (Since we haven't determined
yet which pronouns Qex uses, we're going with a non-specific singular "they" for now.)

In many roleplaying games, characters have a quality that's called their *lineage*, *ancestry*, *culture*,
*race*, or *species*.
If Qex is from a lineage that predominantly has two genders, male and female, roll on
**Lineages with Binary Genders** to determine Qex's gender.

- **Agender** Having no gender or not identifying with any gender.
- **Bigender** A multigender identity that encompasses two genders. These need not be binary genders.
- **Demifemale** A demigender with a connection to femaleness. Also sometimes called *demigirl*.
- **Demigender** A gender identity that feels a partial, but not full, connection to a specific gender. In a culture with 3 or more genders, roll randomly to determine which gender Qex feels connected to.
- **Demimale** A demigender with a connection to maleness. Also sometimes called *demiboy*.
- **Female** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is female has a binary gender, however.
- **Genderfluid** Having a gender identity that changes or cycles over time. Roll an additional 1d4+1 genders to determine which genders Qex shifts between.
- **Male** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is male has a binary gender, however.
- **Multigender** Feeling a connection to two or more genders, sometimes simultaneously. These need not be binary genders.
- **Queer** Queer here indicates that someone doesn't fit into neat categories; they may not even be able to fully define their own gender, but just feel "queer".
- **Xenogender** This refers to someone whose gender isn't expressed in terms of "male" or "female" or the absence of such, but instead may identify with an abstract concept, a color or other sensory characteristics, or a real or imaginary type of creature.

::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera is rolling up a version of Qex for a contemporary game
in the 21st century, so she rolls on the table above. With
a result of 10, she finds that Qex is *genderfluid.*

She then rolls a 1 on the d4 -- see the description of genderfluid
above -- which means Qex's fluidity is primarily between two 
different genders. A roll of 8 establishes one of those 
genders as *agender*, and a subsequent roll of 15 gives
*demimale*. Cadera decides they identify as a *demiboy* instead,
because that sounds more playful.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If Qex is from a lineage that has no intrinsic gender -- such as androids or shapechangers -- roll on 
**Lineage without Assigned Genders**.

:::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For a science fiction game, Cadera rolled up a Qex who is
an android. Androids don't necessarily have an intrinsic
gender, so she rolls on this table. With a roll of 15,
she learns that Qex is *xenogender*. 

Cadera decides that Qex's complex gender involves an 
identification with starships; Qex is vesselgender.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

And finally, if Qex is from a lineage with 3 or more genders, consult 
**Dice for Lineages with 3+ Genders**
for the dice to roll; make a numbered list of the gender options; and roll on 
**Lineages with 3+ Genders**.

Cadera needs a third version of Qex, for a fantasy game in which
one of the races has 4 genders: top, bottom, strange, and charm.
Noting that the chart says *d6+d8*, she makes a list of the four
genders:

1. top
2. bottom
3. strange
4. charm

![A non-binary femme using a makeup brush](art/brush.jpg){.top} \ 

[]{.definitions}

- **Demigender** A gender identity that feels a partial, but not full, connection to a specific gender. In a culture with 3 or more genders, roll randomly to determine which gender Qex feels connected to.
- **Fifth Gender** In a culture with at least 5 genders, this is the fifth one on the list.
- **First Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the first one on the list.
- **Fourth Gender** In a culture with at least 4 genders, this is the fourth one on the list.
- **Hexagender** A multigender identity that encompasses all six gender of a culture with six genders.
- **Multigender** Feeling a connection to two or more genders, sometimes simultaneously. These need not be binary genders.
- **Quadgender** A multigender identity that encompasses all four genders of a culture with four genders. In a culture of five or six genders, roll randomly to see which genders are excluded.
- **Queer** Queer here indicates that someone doesn't fit into neat categories; they may not even be able to fully define their own gender, but just feel "queer".
- **Quintgender** A multigender identity that encompasses all five genders of a culture with five genders. In a culture of six genders, roll randomly to see which gender is excluded.
- **Second Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the second one on the list.
- **Sixth Gender** In a culture with at least 6 genders, this is the sixth one on the list.
- **Third Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the third one on the list.
- **Trigender** A multigender identity that encompasses all three genders of a culture with three genders. In a culture of more than three genders, roll randomly to see which genders are excluded.
- **Xenogender** This refers to someone whose gender isn't expressed in terms of "male" or "female" or the absence of such, but instead may identify with an abstract concept, a color or other sensory characteristics, or a real or imaginary type of creature.

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The d8 rolls an 8, and the d6 rolls 3, for a total of 11. This means
that Qex is of the fourth gender. Counting down the list, Cadera
determines that Qex's gender is *charm*.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### [Trans, Cis, or Otherwise?]{.optional}

Now that we've determined Qex's gender, we can roll to see if they're transgender,
cisgender, or something else.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Trans, Cis, or Otherwise]{.caption}

 2d6    Result
-----   -------------------------
  2     Cisgender
  3     Queer
  4     Neither
  5     Cisgender
  6     Transgender
  7     Cisgender
  8     Transgender
  9     Cisgender
 10     Neither
 11     Queer
 12     Transgender
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Definitions

- **Cisgender** A cis person is someone whose gender matches the gender they were assigned at birth.
- **Neither** Some people don't identify strongly with being either cis or trans, and that's okay.
- **Queer** As before, this is a catch-all category that usually indicates a rejection of strict labels.
- **Transgender** A trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth.

::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling on the table above, Cadera gets an 8, meaning that
Qex -- at least this version of Qex -- is transgender.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### [Open or Hidden?]{.optional}

Does Qex speak openly of being trans, cis, or otherwise? Or do they keep quiet about it?
Roll on **The Closet?** to find out.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[The Closet?]{.caption}

 2d4     Result
-----    -------------------
  2      Still questioning
  3      Openly queer
  4      "No comment"
  5      Loud and proud
  6      Proud but quiet
  7      Self-closeted
  8      Closeted
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
On the Closet? table, Cadera gets a result of 4. So while she knows
Qex is trans, she also knows that Qex doesn't comment on it. It's
really nobody else's business, after all -- or at least, that's
how Qex views the situation.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Genders from Specific Cultures]{.sidehead}

[]{.gamename} doesn't have random rolls to create NPCs with genders tied to
specific cultures, such as [hijra](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Hijra),
[two-spirit](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit),
or [fa'afafine](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine).

Since the author isn't from any of those cultures, she doesn't feel comfortable
in attempting to translate those genders in a roleplaying game. If you are
interested in learning about culture-specific genders, you're encouraged to
do so -- but directly from the works of people from those cultures, not from
QGen!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Pronouns

Anyone can use any pronouns they like! You can find Qex's pronouns by rolling 3d6 on
**Pronouns**.

If a result has three periods (...), then record the pronouns and roll again on this
table.

::::::::::: random :::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Pronouns]{.caption}

 3d6     Pronouns
-----    -----------------------
  3      No pronouns
  4      Xe/xem/xyr
  5      Any pronouns except ...
  6      Neopronouns
  7      She/her and ...
  8      They/them
  9      They/them and ...
  10     She/her
  11     He/him
  12     He/him and ...
  13     They/them
  14     Any pronouns
  15     They/them and ...
  16     Fae/Faer
  17     Ze/Hir
  18     It/Its
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.definitions}

- **Any Pronouns** Some people have no problem answering to any pronoun set.
- **Fae/Faer** These usually indicate some feeling of identification with faeries or fae creatures.
- **He/Him** These are the traditional "male" pronouns.
- **It/Its** Although it's wrong to call anyone it if you don't know their pronouns, some people feel more comfortable with it/its.
- **Neopronouns** Neopronouns tend to be very unique to the individual, and can vary widely.
- **No Pronouns** Some people prefer to not be addressed by pronouns at all.
- **She/Her** These are the traditional "female" pronouns.
- **They/Them** This is usually a singular they.

:::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera realizes she needs pronouns for Qex, so rolls 3d6 and
consults the Pronouns table. Her roll of 9 gives a result of
*they/them and ...* which means Qex uses not just *they/them*
but will also accept at least one other pronoun set.

A second roll on the table gives *she/her*, so Qex's pronouns
are officially *they/she*.

## Attraction

Attraction isn't a simple "do you like boys or do you like girls?" situation. It's
a lot more complicated than that.

The first thing to recognize is that there are varying types of attractions that
omeone might experience -- being sexually attracted to someone is not necessarily
the same thing as being romantically attracted to them, and vice versa.

For purposes of []{.gamename}, we've simplified this to look at just those two
primary types of attraction -- sexual and romantic.

### Sexual Attraction

You can roll on **Sexual Attraction** to determine whether Qex is asexual or allosexual.

:::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::
[Sexual Attraction]{.caption}

 2d4    Sexual Attraction
-----   ----------------------------
  2     Queer
  3     Asexual
  4     Allosexual
  5     Greysexual
  6     Asexual
  7     Allosexual
  8     Asexual
  9     Demisexual
 10     Allosexual
 11     Queer
 12     Asexual
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.definitions}

- **Allosexual** Allosexual people, in contrast to asexual people, experience a desire to have sex with another person.
- **Asexual** Most asexual people experience a lack of sexual attraction. Some may be disinterested in sex, not have a sex drive, or may be repulsed by the idea of sex.
- **Demisexual** A demisexual person is one who doesn't experience sexual attraction to someone unless they have a deep emotional connection.
- **Greysexual** Also called *grey asexual*, greysexual refers to someone who relates to asexuality but feels their experience isn't fully defined by the term *asexual*.
- **Queer** As a type of sexual attraction, queerness is defined by each individual, usually in a way that rejects traditional boundaries.

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera rolls a total of 9 on the **Sexual Attraction** table --
meaning that Qex is demisexual.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Romantic Attraction

Roll 2d4 and check **Romantic Attraction** to discover if Qex is aromantic or alloromantic.

:::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::
[Romantic Attraction]{.caption}

 2d4    Sexuality
-----   ----------------------------
  2     Aromantic
  3     Queer
  4     Alloromantic
  5     Demiromantic
  6     Aromantic
  7     Alloromantic
  8     Aromantic
  9     Greyromantic
 10     Alloromantic
 11     Aromantic
 12     Queer
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.definitions}

- **Alloromantic** Alloromantic people, in contrast to aromanticpeople, experience romantic attraction to other people.
- **Aromantic** Most aromantic people experience a lack of romantic attraction.
- **Demiromantic** A demiromantic person is one who doesn't experience romantic attraction to someone unless they have a deep emotional connection.
- **Greyromantic** Greyromantic refers to someone who relates to aromanticism but feels their experience isn't fully defined by the term *aromantic*.
- **Queer** As a type of romantic attraction, queerness is defined by each individual, usually in a way that rejects traditional boundaries.

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A roll of 4 on the **Romantic Attraction** table finds that
qex is *alloromantic*, which is a fancy way of saying
"not aromantic."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Attraction Parameters

For each type of attraction -- sexual attraction and romantic attraciton --
roll once on **Broad Category of Attraction**. You can also roll on
**Specific Type of Attraction** if you want to pin down Qex's attractions.

:::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Female and Male? Masculine and Feminine??]{.sidehead}

The tables for attraction parameters refer to binary genders. Does that
mean attraction is based on the traditional gender binary, while 
gender themselves are not?

No! In this case, it's reflective of how queer people tend to describe
the groups to which we're attracted in very broad terms. You should
assume that "female" and "male" cover a much broader category of
people than the gender binary would have you believe.

Likewise, the identifications of "feminine", "masculine", and
"androgynous" reflect how queer people talk about our sexualities, but
don't take those terms literally either. "Feminine" and "Masculine"
might mean "femme and butch" in a lesbian context, and
"bear and twink" in a gay male context.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For these tables, first roll 1d6. Then, if there are three periods after the result, roll
another d6 and add it to the first one.

![A transmasculine gender-nonconforming person and transfeminine non-binary person sleeping together in bed](art/bed.jpg){.top .span} \

  15   Male and ...
  16   Female
  17   Non-binary
  18+  Everyone
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling for Qex's sexual attraction first, Cadera gets a 1 --
*Everyone, but especially ...* She notes this down, and since
the result ends in three dots, and rolls again.

The second roll gives a 3, bringing the running total to 4.
Qex likes *Everyone, but especially, female people and ...*

A third roll of 4 produces a running total of 8, so the list of
who Qex likes consists of 
*everyone, but especially female people and non-binary people*.

For romance, a initial roll of 2 means Qex is only romantically
attracted to female people; Cadera doesn't roll again because
there aren't three dots after the result.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### [Specific Type of Attraction]{.optional}

For each result above, you can roll on the next table to see if they've got a "type".
Again, roll 1d6 and keep adding if the result ends in three dots.

:::::::: random :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Specific Type of Attraction]{.caption}

 1d6+  Result
------ --------------------------
   1   Everyone, but especially ...
   2   Traditionally "masculine" and ...
   3   Traditionally "feminine"
   4   Everyone
   5   Traditionally "masculine"
   6   Traditionally "feminine" and ...
   7   Everyone
   8   Androgynous and ...
   9   Traditionally "masculine" and ...
  10   Traditionally "feminine"
  11   Androgynous
  12+  Everyone
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Qex's demisexuality includes attraction to *everyone, female
people, and non-binary people*, and Cadera thinks that's enough
of a "type", sexually. She's much more interested in seeing what
kind of person Qex likes.

An initial roll of 2 means Qex likes *traditionally "masculine"
women*, which Cadera interprets to mean Qex likes butches.
A second roll of 5 gives a running total of 7, which is
*everyone*; so although butch women are a special interest, Qex
is interested in everyone female.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### [The Closet]{.optional}

As with gender, you can use *The Closet* table to roll if Qex
is open about their sexual and romantic attractions, or if they
keep them well hidden.


## [Relationship Status]{.optional}

If you think it may matter, you can roll on **Relationship Status** to determine if 
Qex is single or not.

::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Play Safely]{.sidehead}

Neither GMs nor players should just assume that romance or sexual
activities will ensue between any given characters.

Before such topics even become a potential issue, you should ensure
that you have safety tools in place to prevent discomfort at the
gaming table.

The [TTRPG Safety Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZC)
by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk compiles a number of techniques
designed to make your games safer for everyone.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Relationship Status]{.caption}

 2d6   Status
-----  -------------------------------
  2    Caught in a bad romance
  3    In a polycule of 1d4+1
  4    In a monogamous relationship
  5    Single and looking
  6    Looking for fun
  7    Single, not interested
  8    Looking for friends
  9    Single, not looking
 10    In an open relationship
 11    Disinterested in relationships
 12    Polyamorous, 2d4 partners
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Because Cadera knows her players have a tendency to hit on her NPCs,
she figures she should roll to see if Qex is in a relationship
currently. With a result of 10 on the die, that means Qex is
involved with someone, but it's an open relationship -- good news
for the player characters!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Being single doesn't necessarily mean Qex is willing to flirt with any player character, however.
If you think this might matter, roll 2d6 on **Flirting** to see how Qex normally flirts;
a second time to see how they would like to be flirted with; and a third time for an approach
that will simply not work on them at all.

 2d6     Flirting
-----    -------------------------------
  2      Subtle and sophisticated charm
  3      Sexual innuendo
  4      Not interested in flirting
  5      Playful and teasing flirtation
  6      Mild flirtation
  7      Chaste banter
  8      Adorkable, flustered cluelessness
  9      Earnest compliments
 10      Overwrought melodrama
 11      Aggressive pursuit
 12      Insults and sharp words
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling three times on the Flirting table, Cadera gets these
results, in order:

*8 - adorable cluelessness* This version of Qex is apparently not
the best at navigating courtship, but still looks cute while
doing embarrassing things.

*9 - earnest compliments* That's what will really interest Qex
in someone else -- if they give honest compliments, without
veering into flattery or manipulation.

*3 - sexual innuendo* Crass lewdness is a turn-off for Qex;
anyone trying that will at the very least end up on poor terms
with Qex.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Appearance

Queer people come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and variety. Many times, queer people
are more willing to take risks with their appearance than non-queer people. These tables
will help you determine what Qex looks like.

### Body Shape

Roll 2d6 on **Body Shape Rolls** to determine how many tables to roll on. 
Assume that Qex is unremarkable in any category you don't roll.

Cadera rolls 2d6 to determine which of the tables she'll roll on
to figure out what Qex's body looks like. Rolling a 7, she sees
she'll have to roll on each of the following tables.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Body Shape A (Tall or Short)]{.caption}

 2d4   Body Shape
-----  --------------------------
  2    Very short
  3    Tall
  4    Shorter than average
  5    Average
  6    Taller than average
  7    Short
  8    Very tall
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling 2d4, Cadera gets a 4 -- so Qex is shorter than average.

-----  --------------------------
  2    Very fat
  3    Thin
  4    Heavier than average
  5    Average
  6    Thinner than average
  7    Fat
  8    Very thin
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
["Fat"?]{.sidehead}

Rather than using some euphemism for fat, the tables here
just outright say "fat". There's nothing wrong with being
fat and the term, when used positively, isn't rude.

If you're not sure about all this, you might want to read up
on fat acceptance!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A total of 7 on 2d4 means that Qex is fat.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[Body Shape C (Muscular)]{.caption}

 2d4   Body Shape

With a 4 on the die, Qex is of average curviness.

Putting it all together, Cadera has a clearer image in her head
of Qex: short and fat, but also muscular. "Stocky" is the usual
word for someone like that!

### Hair

:::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling a 7, Cadera sees she has to roll 1d6+1 and 1d6+6.

The first results in a 4, so a total of 5 -- meaning Qex has
"floppy" hair. The second result of a total of 10 gives Qex
shaved sides.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Facial Hair

Anyone of any gender can have facial hair. Roll 2d6 on **Facial Hair** to determine
if Qex has a beard or not.

::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Returning to the hair color table on a lark, Cadera rolls a 5 --
so Qex's beard is purple!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Clothes

While []{.gamename} doesn't include a full clothing generator, you can roll on **Clothing Style**
to get a general sense of Qex's style, then on **Outfit** to determine if their clothing is coordinated
or randomly assembled.

A final roll of 2d4 on the **Clothing** table gives Qex an
unremarkable pair of pants.

## Age

Queer people can be any age. Roll 2d6 to determine Qex's age, then roll for their
apparent age.

:::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera rolls 2d6 and gets a 8 on the die; this means
that Qex is a mature adult. According to the table,
a mature adult rolls 1d8+2 to find their apparent age;
rolling a 2 for a total of 4 means that Qex looks like a 
young adult.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## [Biases and Bigotries]{.optional}

[Content Warning:]{.cw} This section mentions a number of bigotries that an NPC
might have. In no way is this meant as an endorsement of such beliefs, only that
they might appear in a fictional context.

If you think Qex might be a TERF or something, you can roll on **Biases and Bigotries**
to find out.

       irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to 
       produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for Anti-Capitalist purposes 
       only.

       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to 
       exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to 
       circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, 
       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(A)(4) never produces 
       Adapted Material.
       
    1. Downstream recipients.

       a. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the 
          Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise 
          the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this License.

          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).
       
A.  Other rights.

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a 
       collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
       licensing scheme. 


### Section 3 – License Conditions.

          Material:

          i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any 
             others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by 
             the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

          i. a copyright notice;

          of any previous modifications; and

       a. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this License, and 
          include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this License.

    1. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(A)(1) in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed 
       Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by 
       providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
       information.

       License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to 
Your use of the Licensed Material:

A.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(A)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.
