- **Cisgender** A cis person is someone whose gender matches the gender they were assigned at birth.

- **Transgender** A trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth.
- **Neither** Some people don't identify strongly with being either cis or trans, and that's okay.
- **Queer** As before, this is a catch-all category that usually indicates a rejection of strict labels.

### Optional: Open or Guarded?

Does Qex speak openly of being trans, cis, or otherwise? Or do they keep quiet about it?
