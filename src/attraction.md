# Attraction

Attraction isn't a simple "do you like boys or do you like girls?" situation. It's
a lot more complicated than that.

The first thing to recognize is that there are varying types of attractions that
omeone might experience -- being sexually attracted to someone is not necessarily
the same thing as being romantically attracted to them, and vice versa.

For purposes of []{.gamename}, we've simplified this to look at just those two
primary types of attraction -- sexual and romantic.

## Sexual Attraction

You can roll on **Sexual Attraction** to determine whether Qex is asexual or allosexual.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.definitions}

- **Allosexual** Allosexual people, in contrast to asexual people, experience a desire to have sex with another person.
- **Asexual** Most asexual people experience a lack of sexual attraction. Some may be disinterested in sex, not have a sex drive, or may be repulsed by the idea of sex.
- **Demisexual** A demisexual person is one who doesn't experience sexual attraction to someone unless they have a deep emotional connection.
- **Greysexual** Also called *grey asexual*, greysexual refers to someone who relates to asexuality but feels their experience isn't fully defined by the term *asexual*.
- **Queer** As a type of sexual attraction, queerness is defined by each individual, usually in a way that rejects traditional boundaries.

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera rolls a total of 9 on the **Sexual Attraction** table --
meaning that Qex is demisexual.

## Romantic Attraction

Roll 2d4 and check **Romantic Attraction** to discover if Qex is aromantic or alloromantic.

[Romantic Attraction]{.caption}

 2d4    Sexuality

  7     Alloromantic
  8     Aromantic
  9     Greyromantic
 10     Alloromantic
 11     Aromantic
 12     Queer
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.definitions}

- **Alloromantic** Alloromantic people, in contrast to aromanticpeople, experience romantic attraction to other people.
- **Aromantic** Most aromantic people experience a lack of romantic attraction.
- **Demiromantic** A demiromantic person is one who doesn't experience romantic attraction to someone unless they have a deep emotional connection.
- **Greyromantic** Greyromantic refers to someone who relates to aromanticism but feels their experience isn't fully defined by the term *aromantic*.
- **Queer** As a type of romantic attraction, queerness is defined by each individual, usually in a way that rejects traditional boundaries.

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A roll of 4 on the **Romantic Attraction** table finds that
qex is *alloromantic*, which is a fancy way of saying
"not aromantic."

## Attraction Parameters

For each type of attraction -- sexual attraction and romantic attraciton --
roll once on **Broad Category of Attraction**. You can also roll on
**Specific Type of Attraction** if you want to pin down Qex's attractions.

:::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Female and Male? Masculine and Feminine??]{.sidehead}

The tables for attraction parameters refer to binary genders. Does that
mean attraction is based on the traditional gender binary, while 
gender themselves are not?

No! In this case, it's reflective of how queer people tend to describe
the groups to which we're attracted in very broad terms. You should
assume that "female" and "male" cover a much broader category of
people than the gender binary would have you believe.

Likewise, the identifications of "feminine", "masculine", and
"androgynous" reflect how queer people talk about our sexualities, but
don't take those terms literally either. "Feminine" and "Masculine"
might mean "femme and butch" in a lesbian context, and
"bear and twink" in a gay male context.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For these tables, first roll 1d6. Then, if there are three periods after the result, roll
another d6 and add it to the first one.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling for Qex's sexual attraction first, Cadera gets a 1 --
*Everyone, but especially ...* She notes this down, and since
the result ends in three dots, and rolls again.

The second roll gives a 3, bringing the running total to 4.
Qex likes *Everyone, but especially, female people and ...*

A third roll of 4 produces a running total of 8, so the list of
who Qex likes consists of 
*everyone, but especially female people and non-binary people*.

For romance, a initial roll of 2 means Qex is only romantically
attracted to female people; Cadera doesn't roll again because
there aren't three dots after the result.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## [Specific Type of Attraction]{.optional}

For each result above, you can roll on the next table to see if they've got a "type".
Again, roll 1d6 and keep adding if the result ends in three dots.

  10   Traditionally "feminine"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Qex's demisexuality includes attraction to *everyone, female
people, and non-binary people*, and Cadera thinks that's enough
of a "type", sexually. She's much more interested in seeing what
kind of person Qex likes.

An initial roll of 2 means Qex likes *traditionally "masculine"
women*, which Cadera interprets to mean Qex likes butches.
A second roll of 5 gives a running total of 7, which is
*everyone*; so although butch women are a special interest, Qex
is interested in everyone female.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## [The Closet]{.optional}

As with gender, you can use *The Closet* table to roll if Qex
is open about their sexual and romantic attractions, or if they
keep them well hidden.
