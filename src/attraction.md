## Attraction Parameters

For each type of attraction -- sexual attraction and romantic attraciton --
roll once on **Broad Category of Attraction**. You can also roll on
**Specific Type of Attraction** if you want to pin down Qex's attractions.

:::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Female and Male? Masculine and Feminine??]{.sidehead}

The tables for attraction parameters refer to binary genders. Does that
mean attraction is based on the traditional gender binary, while 
gender themselves are not?

No! In this case, it's reflective of how queer people tend to describe
the groups to which we're attracted in very broad terms. You should
assume that "female" and "male" cover a much broader category of
people than the gender binary would have you believe.

Likewise, the identifications of "feminine", "masculine", and
"androgynous" reflect how queer people talk about our sexualities, but
don't take those terms literally either. "Feminine" and "Masculine"
might mean "femme and butch" in a lesbian context, and
"bear and twink" in a gay male context.

For these tables, first roll 1d6. Then, if there are three periods after the result, roll
another d6 and add it to the first one.
