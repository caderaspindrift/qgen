# [Relationship Status]{.optional}

If you think it may matter, you can roll on **Relationship Status** to determine if 
Qex is single or not.

[Play Safely]{.sidehead}

Neither GMs nor players should just assume that romance or sexual
activities will ensue between any given characters.

Before such topics even become a potential issue, you should ensure
that you have safety tools in place to prevent discomfort at the
gaming table.

The [TTRPG Safety Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZC)
by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk compiles a number of techniques
designed to make your games safer for everyone.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Because Cadera knows her players have a tendency to hit on her NPCs,
she figures she should roll to see if Qex is in a relationship
currently. With a result of 10 on the die, that means Qex is
involved with someone, but it's an open relationship -- good news
for the player characters!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Being single doesn't necessarily mean Qex is willing to flirt with any player character, however.
If you think this might matter, roll 2d6 on **Flirting** to see how Qex normally flirts;
a second time to see how they would like to be flirted with; and a third time for an approach
that will simply not work on them at all.

[Flirting]{.caption}

 2d6     Flirting
-----    -------------------------------
  2      Subtle and sophisticated charm
  3      Sexual innuendo
  4      Not interested in flirting
  5      Playful and teasing flirtation
  6      Mild flirtation
  7      Chaste banter
  8      Adorkable, flustered cluelessness
  9      Earnest compliments
 10      Overwrought melodrama
 11      Aggressive pursuit
 12      Insults and sharp words

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling three times on the Flirting table, Cadera gets these
results, in order:

*8 - adorable cluelessness* This version of Qex is apparently not
the best at navigating courtship, but still looks cute while
doing embarrassing things.

*9 - earnest compliments* That's what will really interest Qex
in someone else -- if they give honest compliments, without
veering into flattery or manipulation.

*3 - sexual innuendo* Crass lewdness is a turn-off for Qex;
anyone trying that will at the very least end up on poor terms
with Qex.
