# QGen

QGen is a series of dice tables that can be used to randomly generate a
queer NPC for any tabletop roleplaying game.

**Important Note:** These tables are designed for creating interesting
NPCs, and do not reflect actual demographics of queer people in any way!

## Qex

The example character we'll be referring to throughout this document is
named **Qex** -- standing for "queer example". You would, of course, use
a name of your own choosing if you use this to create an NPC.
