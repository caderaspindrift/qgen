# Pronouns

Anyone can use any pronouns they like! You can find Qex's pronouns by rolling 3d6 on
**Pronouns**.

If a result has three periods (...), then record the pronouns and roll again on this
table.

- **Any Pronouns** Some people have no problem answering to any pronoun set.
- **Fae/Faer** These usually indicate some feeling of identification with faeries or fae creatures.
- **He/Him** These are the traditional "male" pronouns.
- **It/Its** Although it's wrong to call anyone it if you don't know their pronouns, some people feel more comfortable with it/its.
- **Neopronouns** Neopronouns tend to be very unique to the individual, and can vary widely.
- **No Pronouns** Some people prefer to not be addressed by pronouns at all.
- **She/Her** These are the traditional "female" pronouns.
- **They/Them** This is usually a singular they.

:::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera realizes she needs pronouns for Qex, so rolls 3d6 and
consults the Pronouns table. Her roll of 9 gives a result of
*they/them and ...* which means Qex uses not just *they/them*
but will also accept at least one other pronoun set.

A second roll on the table gives *she/her*, so Qex's pronouns
are officially *they/she*.
