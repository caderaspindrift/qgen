# Gender

The first thing we're going to determine about Qex is their gender. (Since we haven't determined
yet which pronouns Qex uses, we're going with a non-specific singular "they" for now.)

In many roleplaying games, characters have a quality that's called their *lineage*, *ancestry*, *culture*,
*race*, or *species*.
If Qex is from a lineage that predominantly has two genders, male and female, roll on
**Lineages with Binary Genders** to determine Qex's gender.

- **Agender** Having no gender or not identifying with any gender.
- **Bigender** A multigender identity that encompasses two genders. These need not be binary genders.
- **Demifemale** A demigender with a connection to femaleness. Also sometimes called *demigirl*.
- **Demigender** A gender identity that feels a partial, but not full, connection to a specific gender. In a culture with 3 or more genders, roll randomly to determine which gender Qex feels connected to.
- **Demimale** A demigender with a connection to maleness. Also sometimes called *demiboy*.
- **Female** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is female has a binary gender, however.
- **Genderfluid** Having a gender identity that changes or cycles over time. Roll an additional 1d4+1 genders to determine which genders Qex shifts between.
- **Male** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is male has a binary gender, however.
- **Multigender** Feeling a connection to two or more genders, sometimes simultaneously. These need not be binary genders.
- **Queer** Queer here indicates that someone doesn't fit into neat categories; they may not even be able to fully define their own gender, but just feel "queer".
- **Xenogender** This refers to someone whose gender isn't expressed in terms of "male" or "female" or the absence of such, but instead may identify with an abstract concept, a color or other sensory characteristics, or a real or imaginary type of creature.

::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Cadera is rolling up a version of Qex for a contemporary game
in the 21st century, so she rolls on the table above. With
a result of 10, she finds that Qex is *genderfluid.*

She then rolls a 1 on the d4 -- see the description of genderfluid
above -- which means Qex's fluidity is primarily between two 
different genders. A roll of 8 establishes one of those 
genders as *agender*, and a subsequent roll of 15 gives
*demimale*. Cadera decides they identify as a *demiboy* instead,
because that sounds more playful.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If Qex is from a lineage that has no intrinsic gender -- such as androids or shapechangers -- roll on 
**Lineage without Assigned Genders**.

:::::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For a science fiction game, Cadera rolled up a Qex who is
an android. Androids don't necessarily have an intrinsic
gender, so she rolls on this table. With a roll of 15,
she learns that Qex is *xenogender*. 

Cadera decides that Qex's complex gender involves an 
identification with starships; Qex is vesselgender.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

And finally, if Qex is from a lineage with 3 or more genders, consult 
**Dice for Lineages with 3+ Genders**
for the dice to roll; make a numbered list of the gender options; and roll on 
**Lineages with 3+ Genders**.

Cadera needs a third version of Qex, for a fantasy game in which
one of the races has 4 genders: top, bottom, strange, and charm.
Noting that the chart says *d6+d8*, she makes a list of the four
genders:

1. top
2. bottom
3. strange
4. charm

::::::::::::::::: qex :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The d8 rolls an 8, and the d6 rolls 3, for a total of 11. This means
that Qex is of the fourth gender. Counting down the list, Cadera
determines that Qex's gender is *charm*.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## [Trans, Cis, or Otherwise?]{.optional}

Now that we've determined Qex's gender, we can roll to see if they're transgender,
cisgender, or something else.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Trans, Cis, or Otherwise]{.caption}

 2d6    Result
-----   -------------------------
  2     Cisgender
  3     Queer
  4     Neither
  5     Cisgender
  6     Transgender
  7     Cisgender
  8     Transgender
  9     Cisgender
 10     Neither
 11     Queer
 12     Transgender
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Definitions

- **Cisgender** A cis person is someone whose gender matches the gender they were assigned at birth.
- **Neither** Some people don't identify strongly with being either cis or trans, and that's okay.
- **Queer** As before, this is a catch-all category that usually indicates a rejection of strict labels.
- **Transgender** A trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth.

::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Rolling on the table above, Cadera gets an 8, meaning that
Qex -- at least this version of Qex -- is transgender.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## [Open or Hidden?]{.optional}

Does Qex speak openly of being trans, cis, or otherwise? Or do they keep quiet about it?
Roll on **The Closet?** to find out.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: random ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[The Closet?]{.caption}

 2d4     Result
-----    -------------------
  2      Still questioning
  3      Openly queer
  4      "No comment"
  5      Loud and proud
  6      Proud but quiet
  7      Self-closeted
  8      Closeted
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: qex ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
On the Closet? table, Cadera gets a result of 4. So while she knows
Qex is trans, she also knows that Qex doesn't comment on it. It's
really nobody else's business, after all -- or at least, that's
how Qex views the situation.
