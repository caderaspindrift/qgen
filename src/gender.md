# Gender

The first thing we're going to determine about Qex is their **gender**. (Since we haven't determined
yet which pronouns Qex uses, we're going with a non-specific singular "they" for now.)

In most roleplaying games, characters have a quality that's called their *lineage*, *ancestry*, *culture*,
*race*, or *species*.
If Qex is from a lineage that predominantly has two genders, male and female, roll on
Table 1: Binary-Gendered Lineage to determine Qex's gender.

If Qex is from a lineage that has no intrinsic gender -- such as androids or shapechangers -- roll on 
Table 2: Arbitrary-Gendered Lineage.

And finally, if Qex is from a lineage with 3 or more genders, consult Table 3: Dice for Multi-Gender Lineages
for the die to roll; list the gender options in order; and roll on Table 4: Multi-Gender Lineages to determine Qex's gender.
