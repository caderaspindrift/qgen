# Gender {.breakbefore}

The first thing we're going to determine about Qex is their gender. (Since we haven't determined
yet which pronouns Qex uses, we're going with a non-specific singular "they" for now.)

In most roleplaying games, characters have a quality that's called their *lineage*, *ancestry*, *culture*,
*race*, or *species*.
If Qex is from a lineage that predominantly has two genders, male and female, roll on
**Lineages with Binary Genders** to determine Qex's gender.

If Qex is from a lineage that has no intrinsic gender -- such as androids or shapechangers -- roll on 
**Lineage without Assigned Genders**.

And finally, if Qex is from a lineage with 3 or more genders, consult 
**Dice for Lineages with 3+ Genders**
for the dice to roll; make a numbered list of the gender options; and roll on 
**Lineages with 3+ Genders**.

## Notes

- **Agender** Having no gender or not identifying with any gender.
- **Bigender** A multigender identity that encompasses two genders. These need not be binary genders.
- **Demifemale** A demigender with a connection to femaleness. Also sometimes called *demigirl*.
- **Demigender** A gender identity that feels a partial, but not full, connection to a specific gender. In a culture with 3 or more genders, roll randomly to determine which gender Qex feels connected to.
- **Demimale** A demigender with a connection to maleness. Also sometimes called *demiboy*.
- **Female** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is female has a binary gender, however.
- **Fifth Gender** In a culture with at least 5 genders, this is the fifth one on the list.
- **First Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the first one on the list.
- **Fourth Gender** In a culture with at least 4 genders, this is the fourth one on the list.
- **Genderfluid** Having a gender identity that changes or cycles over time. Roll an additional 1d6 genders to determine which genders Qex shifts between.
- **Hexagender** A multigender identity that encompasses all six gender of a culture with six genders.
- **Male** One of the two traditional binary genders. Not everyone who is male has a binary gender, however.
- **Multigender** Feeling a connection to two or more genders, sometimes simultaneously. These need not be binary genders.
- **Quadgender** A multigender identity that encompasses all four genders of a culture with four genders. In a culture of five or six genders, roll randomly to see which genders are excluded.
- **Queer** Queer here indicates that someone doesn't fit into neat categories; they may not even be able to fully define their own gender, but just feel "queer".
- **Quintgender** A multigender identity that encompasses all five genders of a culture with five genders. In a culture of six genders, roll randomly to see which gender is excluded.
- **Second Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the second one on the list.
- **Sixth Gender** In a culture with at least 6 genders, this is the sixth one on the list.
- **Third Gender** In a culture with at least 3 genders, this is the third one on the list.
- **Trigender** A multigender identity that encompasses all three genders of a culture with three genders. In a culture of more than three genders, roll randomly to see which genders are excluded.
- **Xenogender** This refers to someone whose gender isn't expressed in terms of "male" or "female" or the absence of such, but instead may identify with an abstract concept, a color or other sensory characteristics, or a real or imaginary type of creature.

## Optional: Trans, Cis, or Otherwise?

Now that we've determined Qex's gender, we can roll to see if they're transgender,
cisgender, or something else.

[Trans, Cis, or Otherwise]{.caption}

 2d6    Result
-----   -------------------------
  2     Cisgender
  3     Queer
  4     Neither
  5     Cisgender
  6     Transgender
  7     Cisgender
  8     Transgender
  9     Cisgender
 10     Neither
 11     Queer
 12     Transgender
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- **Cisgender** A cis person is someone whose gender matches the gender they were assigned at birth.
- **Neither** Some people don't identify strongly with being either cis or trans, and that's okay.
- **Queer** As before, this is a catch-all category that usually indicates a rejection of strict labels.
- **Transgender** A trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth.

### Optional: Open or Guarded?

Does Qex speak openly of being trans, cis, or otherwise? Or do they keep quiet about it?
Roll on **The Closet?** to find out.
