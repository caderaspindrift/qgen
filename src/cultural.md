[Genders from Specific Cultures]{.sidehead}

[]{.gamename} doesn't have random rolls to create NPCs with genders tied to
specific cultures, such as [hijra](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Hijra),
[two-spirit](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit),
or [fa'afafine](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine).

Since the author isn't from any of those cultures, she doesn't feel comfortable
in attempting to translate those genders in a roleplaying game. If you are
interested in learning about culture-specific genders, you're encouraged to
do so -- but directly from the works of people from those cultures, not from
QGen!
