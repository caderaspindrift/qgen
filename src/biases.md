# [Biases and Bigotries]{.optional}

[Content Warning:]{.cw} This section mentions a number of bigotries that an NPC
might have. In no way is this meant as an endorsement of such beliefs, only that
they might appear in a fictional context.

If you think Qex might be a TERF or something, you can roll on **Biases and Bigotries**
to find out.
